<h1>About the app</h1>
<hr>
<p>"Kaiju" have been an important part of my life for...well, almost my entire life. One of the first movies I ever watched was <i>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</i> (the 1956 version, mind you), and I fell in love. I still remember going to the library as a small child and checking out Ian Thorne's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Godzilla-Monsters-Ian-Thorne/dp/0913940682">error-ridden book</a> on the franchise. That's all we had at the time, though, so did I care? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>I "fell out of love" for a while, but after watching Legendary's take on the titular beast, I decided to revisit some of the films I had missed, such as <i>Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: All-Out Monsters Attack</i>, and it was as if I was a kid all over again. Once my son was born, and, like most boys, obsessed over dinosaurs, I knew it was time to introduce him to my childhood friend.</p>

<p>Over the past three or so years, however, I've definitely gravitated more towards the Ultraman franchise. No disrespect to Godzilla: he's a force to be reckoned with and all. However, there's just something to be said about a superhero show where the point isn't violence but compassion, understanding, and forgiveness. Fifty years later, Eiji Tsuburaya's Catholic fingerprints are still all over the show, and it's better for it.</p>

<p>Anyway, the origin of the app is nothing special. I'm a software engineer by profession, so I've been trying to find ways to improve/solidify my skills, and what better way than by building? This idea came to mind as I was thinking of how funny it'd be for someone to be pulled over by the police for not knowing what a speed limit of "1770 Godzillas Per Hour" meant. I mean, who knows what the next few years will bring, so better safe than sorry, right?</p>

<p>As for the actual application itself? For anyone who cares, I used Angular for the frontend work, and there is no backend API or database. I started with regular Bootstrap for some of the styling, but had to switch over to Angular Bootstrap since Angular and jQuery do not play well together.
